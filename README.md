Public who wish to participate in bidding need to register on this site. This application allows public to participate in bidding, booking to the museum as their wish and they can also add details about the historical places.

The website keeps the details of registered users, registered museums, details of ancient artifacts, and booking details on their database. The website will be maintained and managed by administrators. They will have the authority to approve and reject requests for new museums. The administrator will also be able to control the details of the historical places that are added by the public.
